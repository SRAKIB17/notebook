The error you're encountering, Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2), means that MySQL is not running or the socket file is located somewhere else.

### Steps to resolve the issue

#### 1. Ensure MySQL is Running

First, ensure that the MySQL service is running properly. You can do this by restarting the MySQL service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

After restarting, check the status of the MySQL service to ensure that it is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

If MySQL is running, it will display active (running).

#### 2. Check the MySQL Socket File Location

If MySQL is running but the error persists, the socket file might be located in a different directory. To find the correct location of the MySQL socket, check the MySQL configuration file:

```bash
sudo grep socket /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

If the socket file is located somewhere other than /tmp/mysql.sock, use that path when connecting to MySQL:

```bash
sudo mysql --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -u root -p
```

Replace `/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` with the correct path to the socket file.

#### 3. Fix the MySQL Socket Configuration

If the socket file is missing or incorrectly configured, try modifying the MySQL configuration file. Open the my.cnf configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

Ensure that the following lines exist under the [mysqld] section:

```ini
[mysqld]
socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
```

Then under the [client] section, ensure the socket line is present:

```ini
[client]
socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
```

Save the file and restart MySQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

#### 4. Check the MySQL Error Log

If the service still doesnâ€™t start, check the MySQL error log to diagnose the issue:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

Look for any error messages that may indicate the root cause of the problem. If MySQL is failing to start due to data directory or permission issues, those will show up here.

Once MySQL is running, you should be able to run:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
