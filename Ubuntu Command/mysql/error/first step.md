It seems there was an error while trying to configure MySQL after installation. Specifically, the MySQL service failed to start, and the error log
suggests that the daemon could not start successfully. Let's troubleshoot this.

### Steps to resolve the MySQL installation issue

#### 1. Check the MySQL error log

The error log will give more details on why the daemon failed to start

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

Look for any specific errors, such as missing files, incorrect permissions, or misconfigured settings.

#### 2. Check system logs for additional errors

Run the following commands to inspect system logs for more details about the failure:

```bash
sudo journalctl -xeu mysql.service
sudo systemctl status mysql.service
```

This will show you if there are specific system-level issues causing the failure.

#### 3. Verify ibdata1 file existence

The error message says that the file `/var/lib/mysql/ibdata1` does not exist. This file is part of the `InnoDB` storage engine and is critical for MySQL to run. If it is missing, you may need to initialize the MySQL data directory

You can attempt to reinitialize MySQLâ€™s data directory:

```bash
sudo mysqld --initialize --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
```

#### 4. Ensure proper ownership and permissions

Make sure the MySQL data directory has the correct ownership and permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/mysql
```

#### 5.Reconfigure MySQL

Try to force reconfigure the MySQL server packages

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get install -f
```

#### 6. Restart MySQL

After making these changes, attempt to restart the MySQL service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

Check MySQL logs again: If the issue persists, check the logs again for further details:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/mysql/error.log
```
